	HTTP request to web servers can be faked. With that in mind, cyber threat actors can simply send HTTP request with malicious modifications (known as “request spoofing”). Commonly modified part of HTTP request are as follows:
-	Referrer
-	X-forward-for
-	User-agent
-	Cookie data
-	Form data

mention that contained are the cookies and session

Whenever a successful faked request is achieved, session hijacking, csrf 
o	Hijacking = steal a session id an use the stolen session in your requests to impersonate the victim
-	The simplest csrf attack is tricking a user into making a GET request to a URL, an example could be just clicking an image/ hyperlink
-	When an image is loaded the request is automatically run
-	Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
o	A type of attack in which a user is tricked into performing actions on another site by inadvertently clicking a link or a submitting a form
	“Cross-site”: originates on one site but performs an action to another
	“Request Forgery”: it is not a genuine user request
-	Cookie theft


-	Mitigations 
o	Always be vigilant with faked request
o	Session id needs to be random
o	Right use of http methods like GET
o	Honeypots
