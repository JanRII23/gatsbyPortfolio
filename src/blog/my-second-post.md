<!-- ## Introduction to my blog  -->

| December 19th, 2022 | 

<br/>

Calisthenics is slowly gaining traction in mainstream fitness culture because it offers greater functional strength carryover to day-to-day tasks. The aim for this article is to provide a intermediate powerlifting focused workout routine with calisthenics principles applied based on the r/BodyWeight, a fitness reddit page, highly systematic guide.

### | Disclaimer |

<br/>

*  * \- The workout, movements, and progression provided on this blog are for educational purposes and not as a course of action. 
*  * \- Not all exercises are suitable for everyone and this or any other exercise program may result in injury. But keep in mind that exercise is not without risks. 
*  * \- Listen to your body and take a rest day/week if needed, quality is greater than quantity.
*  * \- Don't compare how much you weigh and lift relative to other people, but rather your own individual progress.
*  * \- Most importantly, weight loss is 75% diet and 25%!!

<br/>

### | Workout Routine Day Split |
<br/>

* \- Feel free to modify by adding or removing days, but aim to hit at least 4 days a week of training.
* \- Exercise are to be done as a superset 1st exercise -> rest 1 - 5 min -> 2nd exercise -> 2nd exercise.
* \- Tempo for each exercise is 1 second at the eccentric phase, no pause, then 1 second concentric phase. All 1 fluid movement
* \- If all sets of the given exercise are completed with little to medium effort, feel free to increase by either 1 rep or 5/10 lbs depending on exercise. 
* \- I'm not treating each day of the week as a dedicated workout routine. For example, one Monday may be a Heavy Upper Body routine but another Monday can be a Volume Lower Body routine.
* \- Each day should be as follows -> warm-ups + cardio + day type w/ core triplets.
* \- On mobility days, incorporate some deep stretching with Yoga and foam rolling

<br/>

*  *  *  *  \> Day 1: Workout 1 (Heavy Upper)
*  *  *  *  \> Day 2: Workout 2 (Heavy Lower)
*  *  *  *  \> Day 3: Mobility 
*  *  *  *  \> Day 4: Workout 3 (Hypertrophy/Volume Lower)
*  *  *  *  \> Day 5: Workout 4 (Hypertrophy/Volume Upper)
*  *  *  *  \> Day 6: Mobility OR Rest
*  *  *  *  \> Day 7: Rest
*  *  *  *  \> Repeat day 1 - 7 

<br/>


### | Warm-ups: Dynamic Stretches (5 - 10 min) |
<br/>

* \- Adjust Warm-Ups for special/tight areas of the body.
* \- Feel free to modify by adding or removing stretches, but warm-ups should not exceed more than 10 min.
* \- If you are unfamiliar with the stretch, search on youtube.
<br/>

*  *  *  *  \> 5 - 10 reps of Yuri's Shoulder Band Warm-ups
*  *  *  *  \> 5 - 10 reps of Squat Sky reaches
*  *  *  *  \> 30 seconds Downward Dog to Cobras
*  *  *  *  \> 10 reps of Arch Hangs
*  *  *  *  \> 30 seconds Ring Holds -> Arms straight, Body straight with slight hollow, and depress shoulder blades
*  *  *  *  \> 10 reps of easy squat KOTS + Variations -> deep lunges, heel elevated squats, reverse hyperextensions, and other back warmups
*  *  *  *  \> 10 reps of easy hinge movements -> back extension and single leg back extension
*  *  *  *  \> 10+ reps of GMB Wrist Warm Ups

<br/>

### | Cardio (30 min) |
<br/>

* \- Choose the form of cardio you enjoy below are just recommendations, but a minimum 30 minutes and that doesn't greatly impact you workouts.
* \- Cardio can be performed before or after your workout.

<br/>

*  *  *  *  \> Strength Days -> Stationary bikes or Ellipticals
*  *  *  *  \> Mobility Days -> Treadmill Inclined Walking/Running (2-3 miles)


<br/>

### | Strength Work (60 - 90 min) |
<br/>

* \- Feel free to change compound exercise that works with your training goals and mobility levels.
* \- If you fail a rep, then drop weight by 5/10 lbs or reduce by 1-2 reps.
* \- Don't ego lift!!!!
* \- key, 3 x 6 means 3 sets of 6 reps and AMRAP sets + reps = as much reps as possible with as much sets as needed
* \- Pyramids set are as follows 1 rep -> rest -> 2 rep -> rest ... 8 reps -> rest --> 7 reps --> rest all the way back down to 1 rep to finish the entire pyramids
